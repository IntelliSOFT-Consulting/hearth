# Hearth
A home for [FHIR](http://hl7.org/fhir/).

This project aim to provide a fast and lightweight FHIR server that also supports some of the FHIR-based IHE profiles. It is still in the early stages of development, follow the project to stay informed.

Our high level plan for the project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wJr-A0xJFEwwR9y5c5tVGb0_rH7IQFBJRhMNRU31Fis/edit?usp=sharing).

## Usage
To run in development mode use the followng commands. First Mongo needs to be available on your system. The easiest way to do this is through docker:

```
docker run --name hearth-mongo -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
```
Now start the server in dev mode (which uses a dev namespaced database)
```
npm run dev:start
```
otherwise for production just run:
```
npm start
```

To run the tests:
```
npm test
```

# Pro tips:
* Change the `test:code` script in the package'json to only run the tests you are interested in (just don't commit this!).
* Run `npm run cov` to show coverage details in your browser.
